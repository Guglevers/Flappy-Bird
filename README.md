# 🐤 Simple Flappy Bird Replica

This is just a fun side project I had — and the goal is just as the title says: **build a Flappy Bird replica!!!** 🎮

---

## 💡 Motivations

- Learn more **Python** 🐍  
- Try a little bit of **game dev** 🎲  
- Have some **fun on the weekend** =D  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Just **Python** and **Pygame** — as simple as that! ⚙️

---

## 🔮 For the future...

- I want to make this a **desktop (Windows) application** — but not sure when tho... 🤷  
- Maybe **refine it a little more**, but who knows? I think it's fine as-is.  
  Honestly, might be better to just make **another game** than to insist on this one!

---

## 🏆 Achievements

- For sure, I’ve learned some **OO Python** — actually, this was my **first interaction** with it!  
  I know there are many OO haters out there, but for **game dev** it seems pretty neat. We'll see...

- It was also my first time dealing with an **event loop** — a *really* powerful concept that brings a lot of software to life (like browsers and games).  
  I didn’t use it that much here, but still, super cool to learn about!

- And yeah, I learned a little about **game development** itself!  
  Even though this kinda falls into the Python meme of:

  ```python
  import libThatDoThing  
  libThatDoThing.doThing()

NOTE:
Maybe the README is better than the game itself, does this say something about me?
Nahhh
